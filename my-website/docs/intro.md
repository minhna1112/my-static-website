# Publications Records

I was fortunate to work with a lot of great people, resulting in papers in multiple venues. From 2022 to 2024, as a Research Engineer in FPT Software's AI4Code team, I co-authored papers published in [EMNLP](https://2023.emnlp.org/) and [ICSE](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2024). During my undergrad years, my publications focused more on Robotics Vision and UAVs Navigation. You can find my full publication list here in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xetJ05YAAAAJ).
